				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					Hi! I'm Mekal Covic, also known online as Valoeghese. I'm a kiwi who loves music, anime, and programming, and, in general, learning and being able
					to create stuff for others to enjoy.<br/>
					&nbsp;I am mostly known for my work in the field of Minecraft Modding, with current projects relating thereto being my terrain generator
					"Naturverbunden Terrain", and the Cursed Legacy Project for modding beta 1.7.3 using the modern fabric toolchain, however that is only but
					a small part of what I do.<br/>
					&nbsp;I also compose music. A selection of my music, especially those that relate to other projects I have worked on, have been uploaded to my youtube channel.
